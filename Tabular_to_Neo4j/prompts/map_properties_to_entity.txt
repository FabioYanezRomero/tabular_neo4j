Your task is to determine which properties belong to a specific entity type in a Neo4j graph model.

ENTITY TYPE:
{entity_type}

PROPERTIES:
{properties}

Based on the entity type and properties list, determine which properties truly belong to this entity type. Consider:
1. Semantic relationship between the property and entity
2. Naming patterns and conventions
3. Data type compatibility
4. Domain knowledge

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "properties": [
        {
            "column_name": "original_column_name",
            "property_key": "neo4j_property_name"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your property assignment decisions"
}

JSON response:
