Your task is to determine which entity a property belongs to in a Neo4j graph model based on the data provided.

PROPERTY:
{property}

ENTITIES IN THE DATASET:
{entities}

METADATA:
{metadata_text}

Based on the property, available entities, and metadata provided, determine which entity this property belongs to. Consider:
1. Semantic relationship between the property and entities
2. Naming patterns and conventions (e.g., 'customer_id' likely belongs to a 'Customer' entity)
3. Sample values of the property and their relationship to entities
4. Domain knowledge from the metadata

The property should be assigned to exactly one entity that it most strongly relates to.

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "entity_type": "name_of_entity_this_property_belongs_to",
    "property_key": "neo4j_property_name",
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this property belongs to this entity"
}
