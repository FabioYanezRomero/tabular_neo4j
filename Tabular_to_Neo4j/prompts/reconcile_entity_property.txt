Your task is to reconcile different classification approaches for a column in a CSV dataset to create a consensus model for Neo4j graph modeling. You will receive a 'METADATA' section with column information and a 'DATA' section with different classification results.

METADATA:
- File: {file_name}
- Column: {column_name}
- Primary Entity: {primary_entity}
- Purpose: Reconcile analytics-based and LLM-based classifications to create a consensus model

DATA:
- Initial Classification: {initial_classification}
- Analytics Classification: {analytics_classification}
- LLM Classification: {llm_classification}
- Sample Values: {sample_values}
- Entity Types in Dataset: {entity_types}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, create a consensus classification that considers both the statistical properties of the data and the semantic meaning:

1. If the classifications agree, use that classification
2. If they disagree, determine which is more appropriate based on:
   - The uniqueness and cardinality of the values
   - The semantic meaning of the column
   - The relationship to other columns and entities
   - The overall structure of the graph model

Return your consensus classification as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "consensus_classification": "entity_identifier" | "entity_property" | "new_entity_type" | "secondary_entity_property" | "relationship_property",
    "entity_type": "...",
    "relationship_to_primary": "...",
    "neo4j_property_key": "...",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "..."
}
