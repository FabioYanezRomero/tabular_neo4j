Your task is to determine whether a column in a CSV dataset represents an entity or a property for Neo4j graph modeling. You will receive information about the column and previous classification results.

METADATA:
- Column: {column_name}
- Purpose: Determine if this column represents an entity or a property

DATA:
- Initial Classification: {initial_classification}
- Analytics Classification: {analytics_classification}
- LLM Classification: {llm_classification}
- Sample Values: {sample_values}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, determine whether this column represents an entity or a property:

1. Entity: A distinct object or concept that can stand on its own (e.g., Person, Product, Location)
2. Property: An attribute that describes an entity (e.g., name, age, price)

Consider:
- The uniqueness and cardinality of the values
- The semantic meaning of the column
- The sample values provided

Return your classification as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "consensus_classification": "entity" | "property",
    "entity_type": "..." (if entity, provide the entity type; if property, leave empty),
    "property_of": "..." (if property, provide the entity it belongs to; if entity, leave empty),
    "neo4j_property_key": "..." (if property, provide the suggested property name),
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "..."
}
