Your task is to resolve a discrepancy between rule-based and LLM classifications for a column in a CSV dataset. You need to determine whether this column represents an entity or a property for Neo4j graph modeling.

METADATA:
- Column: {column_name}
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Analytics Classification: {analytics_classification}
- LLM Classification: {llm_classification}
- Sample Values: {sample_values}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, resolve the discrepancy between the rule-based (analytics) and LLM classifications to determine whether this column represents an entity or a property:

1. Entity: A distinct object or concept that can stand on its own (e.g., Person, Product, Location)
2. Property: An attribute that describes an entity (e.g., name, age, price)

Consider:
- The uniqueness and cardinality of the values
- The semantic meaning of the column
- The sample values provided

Return your classification as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "consensus_classification": "entity" | "property",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
}

JSON response:
