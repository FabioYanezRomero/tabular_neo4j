You are a data modeling expert. Your task is to classify a column from a CSV dataset as either an entity or a property for a Neo4j graph model.

COLUMN TO CLASSIFY: {column_name}

METADATA:
- General metadata: {metadata_text}
- Purpose: Determine if this column represents an entity or a property in a Neo4j graph model

DATA:
- Sample Values: {sample_values}
- Uniqueness Ratio: {uniqueness_ratio} (proportion of unique values)
- Cardinality: {cardinality} (number of distinct values)
- Data Type: {data_type}
- Missing Values: {missing_percentage}%

DEFINITIONS:
- Entity: A distinct object or concept that can stand on its own (e.g., Person, Product, Location)
- Property: An attribute that describes an entity (e.g., name, age, price)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the column name, sample values, and analytics
2. Determine if this column represents an entity or a property
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure:

For entity classification:
```
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "classification": "entity",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your classification"
}
```

For property classification:
```
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "classification": "property",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your classification"
}
```

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text before or after.
IMPORTANT: Your classification MUST be either "entity" OR "property", not both.
