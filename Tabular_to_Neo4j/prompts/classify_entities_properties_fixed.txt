You are a data modeling expert. Your task is to classify a column from a CSV dataset as either an entity or a property for a Neo4j graph model.

COLUMN TO CLASSIFY: {column_name}

METADATA:
- General metadata: {metadata_text}
- Purpose: Determine if this column represents an entity or a property in a Neo4j graph model

DATA:
- Sample Values: {sample_values}
- Uniqueness Ratio: {uniqueness_ratio} (proportion of unique values)
- Cardinality: {cardinality} (number of distinct values)
- Data Type: {data_type}
- Missing Values: {missing_percentage}%

DEFINITIONS:
- Entity: A distinct object or concept that can stand on its own (e.g., Person, Product, Location)
- Property: An attribute that describes an entity (e.g., name, age, price)

CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA:
1. Properties typically describe attributes of entities and cannot stand alone
2. Properties are often numeric values, dates, or simple text attributes
3. Entities typically represent real-world objects, people, places, or concepts
4. IDs, codes, and identifiers are typically properties, not entities
5. Columns with names like 'id', 'date', 'amount', 'price', 'count' are usually properties
6. Columns with names like 'name', 'city', 'country' may represent entities
7. Numeric columns (int, float) are almost always properties
8. Date/time columns are almost always properties
9. Email addresses are typically properties of a Person entity

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the column name, sample values, and analytics
2. Determine if this column represents an entity or a property
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure:

For entity classification:
```
{
    "column_name": "actual_column_name",
    "classification": "entity",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your classification"
}
```

For property classification:
```
{
    "column_name": "actual_column_name",
    "classification": "property",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your classification"
}
```

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text before or after.
IMPORTANT: Your classification MUST be either "entity" OR "property", not both.
IMPORTANT: Replace "actual_column_name" with the name of the column you are classifying.
