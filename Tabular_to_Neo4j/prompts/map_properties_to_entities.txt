Your task is to map properties to their respective entities in a Neo4j graph model based on a CSV dataset. You will receive a 'METADATA' section with context information and a 'DATA' section with entity and property details.

METADATA:
- File: {file_name}
- Primary Entity: {primary_entity}
- Purpose: Map each property to the entity it belongs to in the Neo4j graph model

DATA:
- Entity Types: {entity_types}
- Property Classifications: {property_classifications}
- Entity-Property Consensus: {entity_property_consensus}
- Column Semantics: {column_semantics}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, determine which entity each property belongs to:

1. For each property, identify the most appropriate entity owner
2. Consider naming patterns, semantic relationships, and domain knowledge
3. For properties without a clear entity association, assign to the primary entity
4. For relationship properties, identify the source and target entities

Return your property-entity mapping as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "property_entity_mapping": {
        "property_column_name": "entity_type",
        ...
    },
    "entity_properties": {
        "entity_type": [
            {
                "property_name": "...",
                "neo4j_property_key": "...",
                "is_identifier": true|false
            },
            ...
        ],
        ...
    },
    "reasoning": "..."
}
