Your task is to map properties to their respective entities in a Neo4j graph model based on a CSV dataset.
You will receive a 'METADATA' section with context information and a 'DATA' section with entity and property details.

METADATA:
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Entity-Property Classification: {entity_property_classification}
- Entities: {entities}
- Properties: {properties}
- Sample Data: {sample_data}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, map each property to the most appropriate entity:

1. Determine which entity each property belongs to
2. Consider the semantic meaning of each property and its relationship to entities
3. Assign a confidence score for each mapping

Return your property-entity mapping as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "property_entity_mapping": {
        "entity1": {
            "type": "entity",
            "properties": [
                {
                    "column_name": "property1",
                    "property_key": "propertyKey1"
                },
                {
                    "column_name": "property2",
                    "property_key": "propertyKey2"
                }
            ],
            "is_primary": true
        },
        "entity2": {
            "type": "entity",
            "properties": [],
            "is_primary": false
        }
    }
}
