You are a data modeling expert specializing in Neo4j graph databases. I need your help analyzing a column from a CSV dataset to determine its role in a potential Neo4j graph model.

Context: Analyzing column '{column_name}' from a dataset likely representing '{table_subject}'.

Sample Values: {sample_values}

Statistical Profile:
- Uniqueness Ratio: {uniqueness_ratio} (proportion of unique values)
- Cardinality: {cardinality} (number of distinct values)
- Data Type: {data_type}
- Missing Values: {missing_percentage}%
- Detected Patterns: {patterns}

Based on this information, classify this column for Neo4j graph modeling:

1. What is its likely semantic type (e.g., Person Name, City, Product ID, Price, Status, Description, Date, Email Address, Unique Row Identifier)?

2. Should this column represent:
   a. A unique identifier for the primary entity '{table_subject}' (e.g., CustomerID for a :Customer node)?
   b. A descriptive property of the primary entity '{table_subject}' (e.g., age for a :Customer node)?
   c. Values that should become separate nodes of a new type, linked to the primary entity (e.g., a 'City' column might become :City nodes linked to :Customer nodes)? If so, what would be the new node label?
   d. A property of a newly identified linked node type (if applicable from previous point)?
   e. (Advanced) A property of a relationship between the primary entity and a linked node?

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "semantic_type": "...",
    "neo4j_role": "PRIMARY_ENTITY_IDENTIFIER" | "PRIMARY_ENTITY_PROPERTY" | "NEW_NODE_TYPE_VALUES" | "NEW_NODE_PROPERTY" | "RELATIONSHIP_PROPERTY" | "UNKNOWN",
    "new_node_label_suggestion": "...",
    "relationship_type_suggestion": "...",
    "reasoning": "..."
}

JSON response:
