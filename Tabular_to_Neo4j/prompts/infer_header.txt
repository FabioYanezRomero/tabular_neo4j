You are a data analysis assistant. I have a CSV file without headers.

Below are the first few rows of data:
{data_sample}

Please infer appropriate column headers for this data. Consider the data types and patterns in each column.

Return your response as a JSON list of strings, where each string is a header name for the corresponding column.
For example: ["customer_id", "name", "email", "purchase_date", "amount"]

Make sure the headers are:
1. Descriptive of the column content
2. In English
3. Using snake_case format (lowercase with underscores)
4. No spaces or special characters
5. Singular nouns (e.g., "customer_id" not "customers_ids")

JSON response:
