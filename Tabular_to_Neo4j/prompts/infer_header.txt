Your task is to infer appropriate column headers for a table without headers. You will receive a 'METADATA' section containing information about the table and a 'TABLE' section with sample data.

METADATA:
- File: {file_name}
- Purpose: Infer appropriate headers for a CSV file without headers
- Number of columns: {num_columns}

TABLE:
{data_sample}

Based on the METADATA and TABLE sections, infer appropriate column headers for this data. Consider the data types and patterns in each column.

Return your response as a JSON array of strings, where each string is a header name for the corresponding column.
For example: ["customer_id", "name", "email", "purchase_date", "amount"]

Make sure the headers are:
1. Descriptive of the column content
2. In English
3. Using snake_case format (lowercase with underscores)
4. No spaces or special characters
5. Singular nouns (e.g., "customer_id" not "customers_ids")

The response MUST be a JSON array with exactly {num_columns} elements, one for each column in the table.

JSON response:
