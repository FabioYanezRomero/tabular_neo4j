You are a data-modeling expert. Your task is to infer **intra-table** relationships between the entities present in the following table.

### Input
- **Table name**: `{table_name}`
- **Detected entities**: {entities}
- **Columns & analytics** (one per line):
  ```
  {columns_analytics}
  ```
  Each line is formatted as `column_name | data_type | uniqueness_ratio | cardinality | missing_%`.

### Instructions
1. For every meaningful relationship that can be deduced between two *different* entities in this single table, identify:
   • `source_entity` – which entity the relation starts from.
   • `target_entity` – which entity it points to.
   • `relationship_type` – lower-snake-case verb phrase (e.g., `owns`, `contains`, `assigned_to`).
   • `direction` – one of `source_to_target`, `target_to_source` or `undirected`.
   • `confidence` – number 0-1.
2. If no clear relationship exists, return an empty array.
3. Keep reasoning concise (≤ 60 words per relationship).

### Output format
Return **only** a valid JSON object of the form:
```json
{
  "entity_relationships": [
    {
      "source_entity": "EntityA",
      "target_entity": "EntityB",
      "relationship_type": "related_to",
      "direction": "source_to_target",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "reasoning": "Brief justification (≤60 words)"
    }
    // repeat objects as needed
  ]
}
```

Constraints:
- Do not include properties or any text outside the single JSON object.
- Omit duplicate or trivial self-relationships.
