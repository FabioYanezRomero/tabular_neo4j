You are synthesizing a global Neo4j graph schema from multiple tables by identifying synonymous entity labels and proposing unified labels.

### Input
Entity labels detected across tables:
```
{entity_labels}
```

### Task
Identify entity labels that refer to the same real-world concept and propose merged labels. Focus on **semantic equivalence**, not just similarity.

**Important**: Only create merge groups when you have **multiple different entities** that are synonymous. Do NOT create merge groups for single entities.

### Merging Criteria
**DO merge when labels are:**
- Clear synonyms: "Film" ↔ "Movie", "User" ↔ "Customer"  
- Singular/plural variants: "Product" ↔ "Products"
- Capitalization differences: "item" ↔ "Item"

**DO NOT merge when labels are:**
- Different granularity: "Person" vs "Employee" (employee is a subset)
- Related but distinct: "Order" vs "Payment" (different entities)
- Domain-specific variants: "Patient" vs "User" (same person, different contexts)
- **Single entities**: Do not create merge groups for entities with no synonyms

### Output Format
Return **JSON only** (no markdown):

```json
{
"merges": [
{
"from": ["Film", "Movie"],
"to": "Movie",
"confidence": 0.95,
"reasoning": "All terms refer to the same entertainment media concept with no semantic distinction."
}
]
}
```

### Guidelines
- **Merged names**: Preserve one of the original entity labels exactly as it appears (maintaining original case and formatting)
- **Label selection**: Choose the most representative or commonly used label from the merge group
- **Merge requirement**: Only create merge objects when you have **2 or more different entities** to merge
- **Confidence**: high confidence for synonyms, low confidence for probable matches
- **Reasoning**: Justify why labels represent the same concept (≤50 words)
- **No merges needed**: Return `{"merges": []}` if no synonymous entities are found

### Quality Checks
- Ensure merged label represents ALL source labels accurately
- Verify no semantic information is lost in the merge
- Consider domain context when evaluating synonymy
- **Preserve exact formatting**: Do not modify the case or formatting of the selected entity label
- **Never merge single entities**: Each merge group must contain at least 2 different entities
