You are synthesizing a global Neo4j graph schema from multiple tables.
Below is the set of entity labels that were independently detected per table.
Your task is to identify synonyms – labels that refer to the same real-world entity type – and propose a merged label.

### Input
```
{entity_labels}
```

### Requirements
1. Only merge when labels are clear synonyms (e.g., "Film" and "Movie").
2. Do NOT merge labels that represent different concepts even if similar.
3. Keep a label unchanged if no synonym exists.
4. Use concise, lowercase-with-underscores merged names (e.g., "movie").

### Output
Return **JSON only** in the following format:
```json
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "from": ["Film", "Movie"],
      "to": "movie"
    }
    // one object per merge group
  ]
}
```

If no merges are needed, return:
```json
{ "merges": [] }
```
