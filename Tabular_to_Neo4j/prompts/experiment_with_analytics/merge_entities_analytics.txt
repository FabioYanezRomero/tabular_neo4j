You are an expert data architect specializing in entity relationship modeling. Your task is to validate proposed entity label merges by analyzing underlying column data patterns.

### Context
You will receive proposed merges of entity labels (e.g., "Customer" + "Client" → "Customer") along with statistical analytics from columns associated with these entities. Your goal is to determine if the proposed merges represent semantically equivalent concepts.

### Input Data

**Proposed Entity Merges:**

Proposed Merges (JSON format, list of objects, each with 'source' and 'target' entity labels):

{proposed_merges}



**Column Analytics (supporting evidence):**
{column_analytics}


### Validation Criteria

**MERGE IS VALID when:**
- Entities represent the same real-world concept (synonyms, plural/singular variants)
- Associated columns show compatible data patterns (similar distributions, data types, value ranges)
- No semantic information would be lost in the merge

**MERGE IS INVALID when:**
- Entities represent different concepts (even if related)
- Column analytics show incompatible patterns (different data types, disjoint value ranges)
- Merging would create semantic ambiguity

### Analysis Framework

For each proposed merge, evaluate:

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: Do the entity labels refer to the same concept?
2. **Data Compatibility**: Are the statistical patterns from associated columns consistent?
3. **Domain Logic**: Does the merge make sense in the business context?

### Quality Requirements

- **Exclude invalid merges**: Only include merges that pass all validation criteria
- **No identity merges**: Exclude any merge where source equals target
- **Confidence scoring**: Use 0.8+ for clear matches, 0.6-0.8 for probable, exclude <0.6
- **Reasoning**: Justify each validation with specific reference to column analytics (≤50 words)
- **Empty result**: If no merges are valid, return `{"validated_merges": []}`

### Examples

**Valid Merge:**
```json
{
"source": "Film",
"target": "Movie",
"confidence": 0.95,
"reasoning": "Synonymous concepts. Associated columns show identical string patterns, similar length distributions, and comparable uniqueness ratios."
}
```

**Invalid Merge (would be excluded):**

```json
{
"source": "Order",
"target": "Payment",
"confidence": 0.95,
"reasoning": "Different concepts despite relationship"
}
```

**Invalid Merge (would be excluded):**

```json
{
"source": "User",
"target": "User",
"confidence": 0.95,
"reasoning": "Identity merge with no value"
}
```
