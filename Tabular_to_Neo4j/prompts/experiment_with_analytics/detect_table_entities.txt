You are a data-modeling expert. Your task is to determine whether the *entire* table supplied below represents one or more real-world **entities** or is purely a fact/bridge/lookup table with no standalone entities.

### Input
- **Table name**: `{table_name}`
- **Columns & analytics** (one per line):
  ```
  {columns_analytics}
  ```
  Each line is formatted as `column_name | data_type | uniqueness_ratio | cardinality | missing_%`.

### Definitions
- *Entity table*: rows correspond to discrete real-world objects/concepts that can exist independently (e.g., `Customer`, `Product`). At least one column (or combination) acts as a primary identifier.
- *Non-entity table*: rows are facts/measurements/links that only make sense in the context of other tables (e.g., `Sales`, `OrderLine`, many-to-many join tables).

### Reasoning guidance
1. Inspect column names and statistics for obvious identifiers (e.g., `*_id`, `uuid`, codes) with high uniqueness.
2. Consider if most columns appear to *describe* a single thing (entity) versus multiple foreign keys or purely numeric measures.
3. If table is an entity table, group columns into logical *entity* candidates (usually one per table). Edge cases such as polymorphic tables may contain multiple entity typesâ€”list them all.

### Output
Return **only** a valid JSON object in **one** of the following forms:

1. When NO entities are present:
```json
{
  "has_entities": false,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation (<40 words>)"
}
```

2. When the table DOES contain entities:
```json
{
  "has_entities": true,
  "entities": ["EntityName1", "EntityName2"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation (<60 words>)"
}
```

Constraints:
- Do **not** output any text outside the single JSON object.
- `confidence` values must be between 0 and 1.
- Keep `reasoning` short; do not exceed specified word limits.
