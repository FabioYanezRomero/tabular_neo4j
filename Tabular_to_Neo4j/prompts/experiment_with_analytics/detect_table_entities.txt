You are a data-modeling expert. Your task is to identify what real-world **entities** are referenced by the table through foreign key relationships, regardless of whether the table itself is an entity or fact table.

### Input
- **Table name**: `{table_name}`
- **Columns & analytics** (one per line):
{columns_analytics}

Each line is formatted as `column_name | {json_analytics}` where `{json_analytics}` is a compact JSON object containing all available statistics for the column (e.g., data_type, uniqueness_ratio, cardinality, missing_percentage, sample values, etc.).

### Task
Analyze the table columns to identify entities that are referenced through foreign key relationships. Focus on:

1. **ID columns**: Look for columns ending with common identifier suffixes such as "Id", "ID", or "_id".
2. **High-cardinality identifiers**: Columns with moderate to high uniqueness that likely reference other entities.
3. **Naming patterns**: Column names that suggest references to business entities.

### Entity Identification Rules
- Extract the entity name from ID column names by removing common suffixes.
- Consider uniqueness ratios and cardinality to validate if a column is likely a foreign key.
- Ignore purely descriptive columns (dates, measures, flags) unless they clearly reference entities.
- Focus on columns that would logically reference standalone business objects.

### Output
Return **only** a valid JSON object in **one** of the following forms:

1. When NO entity references are found:

```json
{
"has_entity_references": false,
"reasoning": "Brief explanation (<40 words)"
}
```

2. When entity references are found:

```json
{
"has_entity_references": true,
"referenced_entities": ["EntityName1", "EntityName2"],
"reasoning": "Brief explanation (<60 words)"
}
```

### Examples
- `someEntityId` (high cardinality, >0.8 uniqueness) → References `SomeEntity` entity
- `anotherRef` (moderate uniqueness, >0.5 uniqueness) → References `AnotherRef` entity  
- `timestamp` (low uniqueness, <0.1 uniqueness) → Not an entity reference
- `amount` (numeric measure) → Not an entity reference

Constraints:
- Do **not** output any text outside the single JSON object
- Focus on primary and foreign key relationships, not the table's primary purpose
- Keep `reasoning` short; do not exceed specified word limits
