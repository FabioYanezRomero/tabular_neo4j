### Task
You are assisting in designing a Neo4j property schema.

The label **{target_label}** will remain after merging the following labels into it.  

Target label current properties:
{target_properties}

Source label properties (JSON mapping):
{source_properties}

Column analytics (JSON):
{column_analytics}

Your job:
1. Examine all property names across target and source lists.
2. Decide which properties should remain as *distinct* entity properties on **{target_label}**.
   • A property is redundant if it is clearly a duplicate (e.g. same meaning, different casing) of another property already kept.
   • Keep useful descriptive or identifier fields.
3. Return ONLY the final list of property names to keep in **sorted order**.

### Output format
Return a JSON object with one key exactly:
```
{
  "properties": ["prop1", "prop2", ...]
}
```
No other keys. No free-form text.
