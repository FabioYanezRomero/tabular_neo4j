Your task is to classify a column from a CSV dataset as either an entity or a property for a Neo4j graph model. You will receive a 'METADATA' section with column information and a 'DATA' section with sample values and analytics.

METADATA:
- General metadata: {metadata_text}
- Column: {column_name}
- Purpose: Determine if this column represents an entity or a property in a Neo4j graph model

DATA:
- Sample Values: {sample_values}
- Uniqueness Ratio: {uniqueness_ratio} (proportion of unique values)
- Cardinality: {cardinality} (number of distinct values)
- Data Type: {data_type}
- Missing Values: {missing_percentage}%
- Semantic Type: {semantic_type}
- LLM Suggested Role: {llm_role}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, classify this column as one of the following:

1. Entity: A distinct object or concept that can stand on its own (e.g., Person, Product, Location)
2. Property: An attribute that describes an entity (e.g., name, age, price)

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "column_name": "{column_name}",
    "classification": "entity" | "property",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
}

JSON response:
