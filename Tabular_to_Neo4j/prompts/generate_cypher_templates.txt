Your task is to generate template Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph model based on a CSV dataset. You will receive a 'METADATA' section with context information and a 'DATA' section with entity, property, and relationship details.

METADATA:
- File: {file_name}
- Primary Entity: {primary_entity}
- Purpose: Generate template Cypher queries for loading and querying the Neo4j graph model

DATA:
- Entity Types: {entity_types}
- Entity-Property Consensus: {entity_property_consensus}
- Entity Relationships: {entity_relationships}
- Entity Properties: {entity_properties}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, generate template Cypher queries for:

1. Creating primary entity nodes with their properties
2. Creating secondary entity nodes with their properties
3. Creating relationships between entities
4. Setting relationship properties
5. Common query patterns for the domain (e.g., finding connected entities)

For each query, provide:
- A clear description of what the query does
- The Cypher query template with placeholders for CSV column names
- Any constraints or indexes that should be created

Return your Cypher templates as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "cypher_templates": [
        {
            "purpose": "...",
            "query": "...",
            "description": "..."
        },
        ...
    ],
    "constraints_and_indexes": [
        {
            "type": "CONSTRAINT" | "INDEX",
            "entity_type": "...",
            "property": "...",
            "query": "..."
        },
        ...
    ]
}
