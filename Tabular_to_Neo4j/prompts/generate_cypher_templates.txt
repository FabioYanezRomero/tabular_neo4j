Your task is to generate template Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph model based on Entity-Relation-Entity triples. 
You will receive information about entities with their properties and the relationships between them.

METADATA:
- Entities: {entities}
- Relationships: {relationships}
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Sample Data: {sample_data}

Generate the following Cypher templates:

1. ENTITY CREATION: For each entity type, create a template to:
   - Create the entity with its properties

2. RELATIONSHIP CREATION: For each relationship in the format (EntityA)-[RELATION]->(EntityB), create a template to:
   - Match the source and target entities row by row
   - Create the relationship between them

Ensure all entities have Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and all relationships use these UUIDs to connect entities.

IMPORTANT: You must respond ONLY with a valid JSON object and nothing else. No explanations, no markdown formatting, just the JSON object.

Your response must follow this exact structure:
{
    "entity_creation_queries": [
        {
            "query": "CREATE (e:Entity {id: $id, property1: $property1, property2: $property2})"
        }
    ],
    "relationship_creation_queries": [
        {
            "query": "MATCH (a:EntityA {id: $idA}), (b:EntityB {id: $idB}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b)"
        }
    ],
    "example_queries": [
        {
            "query": "MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10"
        }
    ]
}

Response (JSON only):
