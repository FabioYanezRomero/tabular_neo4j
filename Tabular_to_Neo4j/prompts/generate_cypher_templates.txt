Your task is to generate template Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph model based on Entity-Relation-Entity triples. 
You will receive information about entities with their properties and the relationships between them.

METADATA:
- Entities: {entities}
- Relationships: {relationships}
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Sample Data: {sample_data}

Generate the following Cypher templates:

1. ENTITY CREATION: For each entity type, create a template to:
   - Create the entity with its properties

2. RELATIONSHIP CREATION: For each relationship in the format (EntityA)-[RELATION]->(EntityB), create a template to:
   - Match the source and target entities row by row
   - Create the relationship between them

Ensure all entities have Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) and all relationships use these UUIDs to connect entities.

Return your Cypher templates as JSON with the following structure:

{
    "entity_creation_queries": [
        {
            "query": "...",
        },
    ],
    "relationship_creation_queries": [
        {
            "query": "...",
        },
    ],
    "example_queries": [
        {
            "query": "...",
        },
    ]
}

JSON response:
