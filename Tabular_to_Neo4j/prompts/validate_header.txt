You are a data analysis assistant. I have a CSV file with the following headers:
{headers}

Below are the first few rows of data with these headers applied:
{data_sample}

Please evaluate if these headers accurately describe the data in each column. Consider:
1. Do the headers match the data types and content?
2. Are the headers descriptive and clear?
3. Are there any inconsistencies or errors?

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "is_correct": true/false,
    "validated_header": ["header1", "header2", ...],
    "suggestions": "Your explanation of any issues found and suggestions for improvement"
}

If the headers are correct, set "is_correct" to true and keep "validated_header" the same as the input.
If you find issues, set "is_correct" to false and provide improved headers in "validated_header".

JSON response:
