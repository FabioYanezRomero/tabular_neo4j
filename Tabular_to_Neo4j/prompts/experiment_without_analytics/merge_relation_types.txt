You are consolidating a Neo4j graph schema.
Some entity labels have been merged (see list below). For each relationship that connects two of these merged labels, choose a single, concise relationship type name to use consistently.

### Merged entities
Each item represents the set of original labels and the final merged label.
```
{merged_entities}
```

### Candidate relationships
Each line: `source_label --(REL_TYPE)-> target_label`
```
{candidate_relationships}
```

### Task
Identify groups of relationship types that describe the same semantic connection (case/tense differences, synonyms, etc.). Propose a unified `to` name for each group.
Only consider relationship types where BOTH `source_label` and `target_label` appear in the merged entities list.

### Output
Return **JSON only**:
```json
{
  "merges": [
    {
      "from": ["ACTED_IN", "PERFORMED_IN"],
      "to": "acted_in"
    }
  ]
}
```
If no merges are needed, return `{ "merges": [] }`.
