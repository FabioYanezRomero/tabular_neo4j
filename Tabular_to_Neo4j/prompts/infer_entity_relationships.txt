Your task is to infer relationships between entity types in a Neo4j graph model based on a CSV dataset. 
You will receive a 'METADATA' section with context information and a 'DATA' section with entity and property details, as well as a sample from the initial CSV file.

METADATA:
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Entity-Property Consensus: {entity_property_consensus}
- Property-Entity Mapping: {property_entity_mapping}
- Sample Data: {sample_data}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, infer relationships between entity types:

1. Determine the source and target entities for each relationship from the given columns
2. Name the relationships appropriately

Return your entity relationships as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "entity_relationships": [
        {
            "source_entity": "...",
            "target_entity": "...",
            "relationship_type": "...",
            "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        },
    ],
}

JSON response:
