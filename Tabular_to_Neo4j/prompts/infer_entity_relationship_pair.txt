Your task is to infer the relationship between two entity types in a Neo4j graph model based on a CSV dataset. 
You will receive a 'METADATA' section with context information and a 'DATA' section with entity and property details, as well as a sample from the initial CSV file.

METADATA:
- Initial Metadata: {metadata_text}

DATA:
- Entity 1: {source_entity}
- Entity 2: {target_entity}
- Entity-Property Consensus: {entity_property_consensus}
- Property-Entity Mapping: {property_entity_mapping}
- Sample Data: {sample_data}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, infer the relationship between these two entities:

1. Determine if there is a meaningful relationship between these entities
2. Determine the direction of the relationship (which entity should be the source and which should be the target)
3. Name the relationship appropriately based on the semantic meaning
4. Assign a confidence score based on how clear the relationship is in the data

Return your entity relationship as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "entity_relationships": [
        {
            "source_entity": "ENTITY_THAT_SHOULD_BE_SOURCE",
            "target_entity": "ENTITY_THAT_SHOULD_BE_TARGET",
            "relationship_type": "APPROPRIATE_RELATIONSHIP_NAME",
            "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
            "bidirectional": false,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this relationship exists and its direction"
        }
    ]
}

Example:
```json
{
    "entity_relationships": [
        {
            "source_entity": "customer_name",
            "target_entity": "country",
            "relationship_type": "resides_in",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "bidirectional": false,
            "reasoning": "The 'country' entity directly relates to the 'customer_name' entity, indicating the country where the customer resides."
        }
    ]
}
```

Example (no relationship):
```json
{
    "entity_relationships": []
}
```

If there is a meaningful relationship in both directions, you can set "bidirectional" to true and provide a relationship that makes sense in the direction specified.

If there is no clear relationship between these entities, return an empty array for entity_relationships.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no additional text before or after.
