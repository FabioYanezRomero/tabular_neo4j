Your task is to translate column headers to a target language if needed. You will receive a 'METADATA' section containing information about the headers and target language, and a 'DATA' section with the current headers.

METADATA:
- File: {file_name}
- Purpose: Translate column headers to target language if needed
- Target language: {target_language}

DATA:
{headers}

Based on the METADATA and DATA sections, determine if the headers in the DATA section are already predominantly in {target_language}. If not, or if they are mixed, translate all headers to {target_language}.

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "is_in_target_language": true/false,
    "translated_header": ["header1", "header2", ...]
}

If the headers are already in the target language, set "is_in_target_language" to true and keep "translated_header" the same as the input.
If translation is needed, set "is_in_target_language" to false and provide the translated headers in "translated_header".

When translating, maintain the same formatting style (snake_case) and ensure the translations accurately reflect the meaning of the original headers.
The translated_header list MUST have the same length as the original headers list.
