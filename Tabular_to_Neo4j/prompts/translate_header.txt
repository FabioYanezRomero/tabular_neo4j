You are a data analysis assistant. I have a CSV file with the following headers:
{headers}

The target language for these headers is: {target_language}

Please determine if these headers are already predominantly in {target_language}. If not, or if they are mixed, translate all headers to {target_language}.

Return your analysis as JSON with the following structure:
{
    "is_in_target_language": true/false,
    "translated_header": ["header1", "header2", ...]
}

If the headers are already in the target language, set "is_in_target_language" to true and keep "translated_header" the same as the input.
If translation is needed, set "is_in_target_language" to false and provide the translated headers in "translated_header".

When translating, maintain the same formatting style (snake_case) and ensure the translations accurately reflect the meaning of the original headers.

JSON response:
